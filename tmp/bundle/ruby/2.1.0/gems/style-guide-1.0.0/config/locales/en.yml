        radios are for selecting one option from many.

        for controls to appear on the same line.
      controls_input: >
        Most common form control, text-based input fields.
        Includes support for all HTML5 types:
        text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week,
        number, email, url, search, tel, and color.
        Requires the use of a specified `type` at all times.

        to show multiple options at once.

        Change the `rows` attribute as necessary.

      # layouts
      default_styles: >
        Individual form controls receive styling, but without any required base
        class on the `<form>` or large changes in markup.
        Results in stacked, left-aligned labels on top of form controls.
      horizontal: >
        Right align labels and float them to the left to make them appear on
        the same line as controls.
        Requires the most markup changes from a default form:
          * Add `.form-horizontal` to the form
          * Wrap labels and controls in `.control-group`
          * Add `.control-label` to the label
          * Wrap any associated controls in `.controls` for proper alignment
      inline: >
        Add `.form-inline` for left-aligned labels and inline-block
        controls for a compact layout.
      search: >
        Add `.form-search` to the form and `.search-query`
        to the `<input>` for an extra-rounded text input.

    tables:

        dividers – add the base class `.table` to
        any `<table>`.
      striped: >
        `.table-striped`
        adds zebra-striping to any table row within the
        `<tbody>` via the `:nth-child` CSS selector
        (not available in IE7-IE8).
      bordered: >
        `.table-bordered`
        adds borders and rounded corners to the table.
      hover: >
        `.table-hover`
        enables a hover state on table rows within a `<tbody>`.
      condensed: >
        `.table-condensed`
        makes tables more compact by cutting cell padding in half.
      row_classes: >
        Use contextual classes to color table rows.

    typography:
      body_copy: >
        Bootstrap's global default `font-size` is
        <strong>14px</strong>, with a `line-height` of
        <strong>20px</strong>. This is applied to the `<body>`
        and all paragraphs. In addition, `<p>` (paragraphs)
        receive a bottom margin of half their line-height (10px by default).
        Make a paragraph stand out by adding `.lead`.

      headings: >
        All HTML headings, `<h1>` through
        `<h6>` are available.

      code_inline: >
        Use `<code>` for inline snippets of code.
      code_blocks: >
        Use `<pre>` for multiple lines of code.
        Be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering.
            images_placeholders: >
        Add classes to an `<img>` element to easily
        style images in any project.
